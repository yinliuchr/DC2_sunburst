# DC2_sunburst
## DC2 of CS765 
## How to use my prototype:
### Download and file arrange
Download or clone the zip from my github. Put the whole content of json data like http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Vis/CS765-2018-DC2-ExampleData/12-medium-8-0.json into a file. (Attention: it will only work when there is only one root node as explained before). Name the file ‘jbn’, put it with ‘jbn.py’ at the same directory (RWJson).
### Generate
Run 'jbn.py' and you will get a file named 'data.json'.
Copy the whole content of 'data.json' and replace the content in the 'children[]' in the index.html file. 
### Visualise!
Double click index.html file in your own laptop and you will get the fantastic view!
